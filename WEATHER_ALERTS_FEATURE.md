# üå™Ô∏è Weather & Natural Disaster Alert Feature

## Overview

This feature adds real-time weather and natural disaster monitoring to help investors make informed decisions. Natural disasters can significantly impact stock markets, supply chains, and regional economies.

- **Insurance Companies**: Major disasters lead to massive claims
- **Agriculture**: Droughts, floods, and storms impact crop yields and food prices
- **Real Estate**: Earthquakes, wildfires, and floods affect property values
- **Manufacturing**: Facility damage and workforce disruption
- **Regional Economies**: Major disasters slow economic activity in affected areas

## Frontend Components

### WeatherAlerts Component

Displays weather alerts at the top of key pages:
- **Dashboard**: Overview of all alerts
- **Strategies**: Alerts when analyzing trading strategies
- **Predictions**: Alerts when making ML predictions

**Features:**
- Color-coded severity badges
- Dismissible alerts
- Manual refresh button
- Auto-refresh every 30 minutes
- Detailed alert information
- Market impact recommendations

## Usage Example

When viewing the **Strategies** page:

1. If there are severe weather alerts, you'll see a banner at the top
2. The banner shows:
   - Overall market impact level (High, Moderate, Low)
   - Number of alerts detected

- Shows placeholder message
- Explains how to enable the feature
- Provides sign-up link

## Cost Considerations

**OpenWeatherMap Free Tier:**
- 1,000 API calls per day
- With auto-refresh every 30 minutes: ~48 calls per day per user
- Sufficient for personal use and small teams

**For Production:**
- Consider upgrading to paid tier for higher limits
- Implement server-side caching to reduce API calls
- Monitor usage through OpenWeatherMap dashboard

## High-Impact Weather Events

The system specifically monitors:
- üåÄ Hurricanes & Typhoons
- üåä Tsunamis
- üå™Ô∏è Tornadoes
- üî• Wildfires
- üíß Major Floods
- üåç Earthquakes
- ‚ùÑÔ∏è Severe Blizzards
- ‚õàÔ∏è Severe Storms
- üåÄ Cyclones

## Best Practices

1. **Check alerts before major investments**
2. **Monitor affected regions** if you're invested in region-specific stocks
3. **Consider diversification** during high-alert periods
4. **Don't panic** - evaluate the specific impact on your portfolio
5. **Use alerts as one factor** among many in your investment decisions

## Technical Details

### Backend Architecture
- **Module**: `backend/utils/weather_alerts.py`
- **API Integration**: OpenWeatherMap One Call API 3.0
- **Caching**: Can be enabled to reduce API calls
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks if API is unavailable

### Frontend Architecture
- **Component**: `frontend/src/components/WeatherAlerts.jsx`
- **Auto-refresh**: Every 30 minutes
- **State Management**: React hooks
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with dynamic color coding

## Troubleshooting

### Alerts Not Showing

1. **Check API Key**:
   ```bash
   # In backend/.env
   OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```

2. **Verify Backend is Running**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:5000/api/weather-alerts
   ```

3. **Check Browser Console** (F12) for errors

4. **Ensure API Key is Valid**:
   - Visit OpenWeatherMap dashboard
   - Verify key is active
   - Check you've subscribed to One Call API 3.0

### API Rate Limits
