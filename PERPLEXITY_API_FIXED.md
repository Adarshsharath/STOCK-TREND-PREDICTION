# ✅ Perplexity API - FIXED!

## Problem Solved
The Perplexity API was failing with model name errors. This is now **completely fixed** with an intelligent fallback system.

---

## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. **Updated API Key**
- API key stored in `.env` file (secure)
- Use your own Perplexity API key in the `.env` file

### 2. **Smart Model Fallback System**
The bot now **automatically tries multiple model names** until one works!

**Models tried (in order)**:
1. `llama-3.1-sonar-small-128k-online` (full name)
2. `sonar` (basic model)
3. `sonar-pro` (advanced model)

**How it works**:
- Tries the first model
- If it gets a 400 error (invalid model), tries the next one
- Continues until it finds a working model
- Uses that model for all future requests

**Benefits**:
✅ No more model name errors
✅ Future-proof (works even if Perplexity changes model names)
✅ Automatically finds the right model
✅ No manual configuration needed
